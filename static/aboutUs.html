			<h2>Why We Do What We Do</h2>
		</div>
        
        <p>Women cannot easily report sexual assault. Pushing past the insecurities and finding the strength to report an incident is the first hurdle. Finding the resources to report a sexual assault incident is an even more difficult task. We want to produce a way for victims of sexual assault to keep a record of the incident (write), provide support for them (recover), and supply an easy, streamlined way for them to find help (report). </p>

			<h2>Statistics</h2>
			<span class="byline">To show the extent of sexual assault. Help us help others from becoming another statistic.</span>
		</div>
		<p>One in 5 women and one in 13 men will be sexually assaulted during their college career in the United States.<br>
		Less than 10% will ever report their assault to their school or to the police. <br>
	    On average, those who do report wait 11 months.<br>
		90% of sexual assaults are committed by repeat offenders.<br>
		Only 6% of sexual assaults reported to police end with the assailant spending a single day in prison7, meaning that there's a 99% chance that they'll get away with it. This means there is practically no deterrent to sexual assault in the US.
        <br>We could prevent 59% of assaults from ever occurring - just by halting repeat offenders earlier on.<br></p>
